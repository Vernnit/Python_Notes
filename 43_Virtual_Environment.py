# A virtual environment is a tool used to isolate specific Python environments on a single machine, allowing you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies and packages without conflicts. This can be especially useful when working on projects that have conflicting package versions or packages that are not compatible with each other.

# Create a virtual environment
# python -m venv myenv

# # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
# source myenv/bin/activate

# # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
# myenv\Scripts\activate.bat or .ps1 or simply activate

#  simply write deactivate to deactivate virtual environment.


#A script is a Python file that's intended to be run directly. When you run it, it should do something. This means that scripts will often contain code written outside the scope of any classes or functions. A module is a Python file that's intended to be imported into scripts or other modules.
