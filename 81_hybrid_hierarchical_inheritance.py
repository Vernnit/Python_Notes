'''Hybrid Inheritance is a blend of more than one type of inheritance. The class is derived from the two classes as in the multiple inheritance. However, one of the parent classes is not the base class. It is a derived class.

In Python, hybrid inheritance can be implemented by creating a class hierarchy, in which a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes, and one of the derived classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.'''

# Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple subclasses inherit from a single base class. In other words, a single base class acts as a parent class for multiple subclasses. This is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner.
